 Implemented an automated evaluation system for subjective answers in assessments using Machine Learning and NLP
 techniques; reduced grading time and improved accuracy.
 Created advanced machine learning models capable of evaluating the relevance of subjective answers, leading to a reduction
 in manual review effort by an estimated 30 hours per month for educators.
 Developed an automated system for three main users—Student, Teacher, and Admin—that significantly reduced manual
 effort and optimized the grading of subjective answers.
